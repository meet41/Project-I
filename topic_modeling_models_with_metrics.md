  - Fast to train, scalable with extensions (e.g., Online LDA)
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Bag-of-words (ignores word order/context)  
  - Can struggle with short/noisy texts  
  - Requires selection of topic count
- **Scalability:** High (up to millions of docs with online/distributed LDA)
- **Performance:** Fast on moderate data; slows with extreme scale unless parallelized
