# Text Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Lowercasing:**  
   Converts all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity (e.g., "Apple" and "apple" are treated the same).
2. **Removing Punctuation:**  
   Eliminates punctuation marks such as commas, periods, exclamation points, etc., unless needed for analysis.
3. **Removing Stop Words:**  
   Removes common words that carry little semantic meaning (e.g., "the", "is", "a").
4. **Tokenization:**  
   Splits text into individual words or tokens.
5. **Stemming:**  
   Reduces words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run").
6. **Lemmatization:**  
   Reduces words to their base or dictionary form, considering context (e.g., "better" → "good").
7. **Removing Numbers:**  
   Removes numerical values that may not be relevant for certain analyses.
8. **Removing URLs and HTML Tags:**  
   Strips out website links and HTML code fragments.
9. **Handling Special Characters and Emojis:**  
   Removes or converts special characters and emojis into a usable format.
10. **Handling Chat Words, Slang, and Typos:**  
    Expands abbreviations, corrects common misspellings, and normalizes informal language.
