# Topic Modeling Approaches: Models, Features, and Recommendations

## 1. BASIC MODELS (Good for Small Datasets / Starting Point)

### a) TF-IDF + Clustering (K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering)
**Features:** Converts text into weighted word vectors, groups similar documents into clusters.

**Advantages:**
- Easy to implement.
- Interpretable topics (top words per cluster).
- Works well for small datasets (<50k documents).

**Disadvantages:**
- Ignores word order and context.
- Performance degrades on large datasets.
- Requires predefining number of clusters.

**Scalability & Metrics:**
- Small datasets: Fast and efficient.
- Large datasets: Requires dimensionality reduction (PCA).
- Accuracy depends heavily on preprocessing.

**Research Usage:** Baseline in many topic modeling papers as a comparative model.

### b) Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
**Features:** Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to uncover latent semantic structure.

**Advantages:**
- Captures relationships between terms better than raw TF-IDF.
- Good for small and medium datasets.

**Disadvantages:**
- Topics are often not easily interpretable.
- Struggles with polysemy (words with multiple meanings).

**Scalability:**
- Works for ~100k documents but SVD is computationally expensive.

**Research Usage:** Common baseline in information retrieval studies.

## 2. INTERMEDIATE MODELS (For Medium-Scale Data)

### a) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
**Features:** Probabilistic model assigning documents to multiple topics.

**Advantages:**
- Produces interpretable topic-word distributions.
- Widely used in research and industry.

**Disadvantages:**
- Assumes bag-of-words (ignores word order).
- Sensitive to hyperparameters (alpha, beta, number of topics).

**Scalability & Performance:**
- Small datasets: Works well with ~10-50 topics.
- Large datasets (>1M docs): Use online or distributed LDA (e.g., SparkLDA).

**Metrics:** Perplexity, Coherence Score.

**Research Usage:** Foundational model in NLP topic discovery papers.

### b) Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
**Features:** Factorizes term-document matrix to discover topics.

**Advantages:**
- Produces parts-based, interpretable representations.
- Often yields more coherent topics than LDA for short texts.

**Disadvantages:**
- Lacks probabilistic foundation.
- Needs predefined topic number.

**Scalability:** Handles medium datasets (up to ~500k documents).

**Research Usage:** Frequently compared with LDA in topic modeling research.

### c) Biterm Topic Model (BTM)
**Features:** Designed for short texts like tweets or chat messages.

**Advantages:**
- Better than LDA for sparse, short documents.
- Captures word co-occurrences across entire corpus.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires good preprocessing.
- Topics less interpretable for long texts.

**Scalability:** Handles ~1M short texts efficiently.

**Research Usage:** Popular in social media and micro-text analysis papers.

## 3. ADVANCED MODELS (For Large-Scale / High Accuracy)

### a) BERTopic
**Features:** Combines BERT embeddings + UMAP (dimensionality reduction) + HDBSCAN (clustering).

**Advantages:**
- Context-aware (uses sentence embeddings).
- Automatically determines number of topics.
- Dynamic topic reduction and visualization.

**Disadvantages:**
- Computationally expensive for millions of documents.
- Requires GPU for efficiency.

**Scalability & Performance:**
- Small datasets (~10k): Very high accuracy and coherence.
- Large datasets (>500k): Needs distributed processing.
- Excellent topic coherence compared to LDA.

**Research Usage:** Frequently cited in 2021–2024 papers for semantic topic discovery.

### b) Top2Vec
**Features:** Embeds documents & words in same vector space; topics emerge from dense clusters.

**Advantages:**
- No need to choose number of topics.
- Works well for semantic similarity.

**Disadvantages:**
- Memory-intensive on large corpora.
- Slower than LDA on CPU.

**Scalability:** Handles ~1M documents with sufficient hardware.

**Research Usage:** Used in semantic topic discovery and recommendation systems.

### c) Prompt-based Models (LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, or T5)
**Features:** Uses large language models with prompt engineering to label topics.

**Advantages:**
- Extremely flexible (can generate summaries + topics).
- Few-shot and zero-shot capabilities.

**Disadvantages:**
- High inference cost.
- Limited transparency in how topics are generated.

**Scalability:**
- Small datasets: Highly accurate.
- Large datasets: Needs batching and cost optimization.

**Research Usage:** Emerging in 2023–2025 for explainable topic discovery.
